Description :
-------------

SWoOZ is a software platform written in C++ used for behavioral experiments based on interactions between people and robots or 3D avatars.


Content :
---------
 * A toolkit for working with tracking devices :
   * [interfaces](https://github.com/GuillaumeGibert/swooz/wiki/toolkit#wiki-devices) (Kinect/Xtion, FaceLab, Fastrak Polhemus, Tobii..)
   * [depth captor data recorder/loader](https://github.com/GuillaumeGibert/swooz/wiki/samplesCode#data-recorderloader) 
 * Modules based on yarp :
   * [Tracking](https://github.com/GuillaumeGibert/swooz/wiki/tracking) human movements without intrusive devices : head rigid/non-rigid motion, arms(not online now), torso
   * [Teleoperation](https://github.com/GuillaumeGibert/swooz/wiki/teleoperation) for iCub, NAO(not online now), 3D Avatars(not online now) based on the tracking modules
 * Avatar creation/morphing :
   * [Creation](https://github.com/GuillaumeGibert/swooz/wiki/avatar#wiki-creation) from depths sensors devices(Kinect/Xtion) data
   * [Morphing](https://github.com/GuillaumeGibert/swooz/wiki/avatar#wiki-morphing) for fitting references avatars meshes


Research :
----------

SWoOZ is a research project funded by the program "Retour Post-Doctorants" of l'Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) during 3 years.
The originality of this project relies on the full control of avatars' and/or robots' behaviours by a human becoming a puppeteer. 

The project will have two clear phases :

 * during the first phase (year 1, 2012), we are going to develop an open source research platform. This platform will consist of sensors able to track human motion in 3D, software programs to convert motion into articulatory parameters and avatars and robots mimicking accurately and in real-time a confederateâ€™s behaviours. The platform will be delivered as an open-source software at the end of the project.
 * during the second phase (year 2 and 3, 2013-2014), a series of behavioural and neuroimaging experiments will be conducted to investigate several aspects of human-machine interaction.
